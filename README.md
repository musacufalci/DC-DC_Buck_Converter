# DC-DC Buck Converter

- switching frequency: 25KHz 
- ripple value: 0.01 
- D: 0.41 
- L: 100uH 
- C: 118uF


Because DC/DC step-down (buck) converters feature a controller with one or more integrated FETs and an external inductor, they offer a balance of flexibility and ease of use. Both non-synchronous (integrated high-side FET and external diode) and synchronous (integrated high-side and low-side FETs) buck converters simplify the design process by reducing external component count. At the same time, having control over the selection of an external inductor lets you optimize your power supply for efficiency, size or cost...
